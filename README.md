# Code Radio App

A tiny cross-platform app for FreeCodeCamp's [Code Radio](https://coderadio.freecodecamp.org/) built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/).

The idea behind this app is to play music while coding without a browser pigging out on your computer's memory.

Still very much a WIP! ðŸš€
